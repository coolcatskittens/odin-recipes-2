        <li>3 tablespoons toasted chopped pecans or walnuts</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons toasted unsweetened coconut flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped candied ginger (Optional)</li>    
    </ul>
   
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>To make the pancake batter: Whisk flour, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add buttermilk, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla; stir until just combined. Stir in carrots and melted butter until just combined. Set batter aside while you prepare the frosting and topping.</li>
        <li>To make the frosting: Whisk cream cheese, milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla together in a medium bowl until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>To prepare the topping: Stir raisins, pecans, coconut, and ginger together in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat; grease with butter.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup batter per pancake into the skillet, being sure not to overcrowd it. Cook until bubbles begin to form on surface of pancakes and edges look dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until fluffy and slightly firm, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter, adding butter and adjusting heat as needed.</li>
        <li>Divide pancakes evenly among 4 plates; drizzle evenly with frosting and sprinkle evenly with topping.</li>
